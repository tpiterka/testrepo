There's nothing really wrong with this episode, though it's a little sad that it is so unoriginal - there are shades of both "Yesterday's Enterprise" and of "Children of Time" here. 
The cast do a pretty good job, especially Jolene Blalock, and the story makes a fair degree of sense. 
The time travel elements don't really hold up to logic, but then Star Trek stories with time travel never do so that's hardly an original complaint.

Since when do Xindi have transporter technology? 
They have ALWAYS had to hard dock to get from ship to ship before, even when attacking Enterprise in "Rajin". 
Now they suddenly have transporters so they can kidnap Hoshi?
